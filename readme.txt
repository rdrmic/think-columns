Start playing by running main.pyw ;)


SCORING
========
Well, when you put 3 or more blocks of the same color in either of 4 directions
(horizontal, vertical, 2 diagonals) you gain points.

The more same-colored blocks in a line, the more points you get:
    3 blocks    1 point
    4 blocks    2 points
    5 blocks    3 points
    6 blocks    4 points (very, very, VERY rare situation ;)

You get extra points for multiple matched lines in one matching as well:
    1 match     0 extra points
    2 matches   1 extra point
    3 matches   2 extra points
    ...
When this happens you'll get "MULTI +X" message.

Also, extra points are earned when blocks are fallen (dropped) and there are
more matches one after another, before another blocks start to fall - you'll get
1 additional point for every of those 'chain matches'.
When this happens you'll get "CHAIN +X" message.
